# Matrixcalculator
A basic core java project using swing which helps to solve the operations performed in matrix like Matrix multiplication, Scalar multiplication, Determinant, etc.
As we all know in first two years of engineering we have a subject maths, where we use a calculator to solve the operations of matrix. Keeping thus un mind i created this Project for my core-java internship.
